Game Rules | 2048 Number Puzzle
===============================

2048 is a single-player puzzle game played on a 4x4 grid. The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on the grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when this tile appears on the grid, and it is lost when there are no more moves available (all the spaces on the grid are filled and there are no more moves that can be made).

Here's how to play:

*   Use the arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the combined value of the two tiles.
*   When a new tile is created, it is placed randomly on an empty spot on the grid.
*   The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the grid.
*   The game is lost when there are no more moves available (all the spaces on the grid are filled and there are no more moves that can be made).

To move the tiles, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. When two tiles with the same number touch, they will merge into one tile with the combined value of the two tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will combine to create a single tile with the number 4. A new tile is placed randomly on an empty spot on the grid each time a move is made.

So, how do you win at 2048? The key is to strategize your moves and plan ahead. Try to keep the highest-value tiles towards the corners of the grid, as this will make it easier to combine them with other tiles. It can also be helpful to try to create a "monochromatic" grid, where all the tiles are the same number. This will make it easier to combine the tiles and work towards the 2048 tile.

### The history of 2048

2048 was created by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. The game was inspired by another popular puzzle game called Threes, but with the added twist of having a specific goal tile (the 2048 tile). Cirulli released the game as an open-source project, and it quickly gained popularity and spawned numerous knock-offs and variations.

Since its release, 2048 has been played by millions of people worldwide and has even been featured in media outlets such as Forbes and The New York Times. Its simple yet challenging gameplay has made it a hit among puzzle game enthusiasts of all ages.
